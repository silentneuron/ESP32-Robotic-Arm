# ESP32-Robotic-Arm
A simple 3DOF robotic arm works on arduino IDE with opencv integration too
I have given full detailed steps to be followed u can buy the hardware parts from here
https://robu.in/product/pro-range-esp32-robotic-arm-with-web-control-kit/
or download 3d files and start tinkering
I have put a lot of efforts to pull this but it was worth this is a fresh Repo because older one was too haphazard please say if any changes required especially in the OpenCV parts
